CHAPTER 8
EDIBLE FRUIT AND NUTS; PEEL OF CITRUS FRUIT OR MELONS
NOTES:1.
This Chapter does not cover inedible nuts or fruits.
2.
Chilled fruits and nuts are to be classified in the same headings as the corresponding fresh fruits and nuts.
3.
Dried fruit or dried nuts of this Chapter may be partially rehydrated, or treated for the following purposes:(a)
for additional preservation or stabilisation (for example, by moderate heat treatment, sulphuring, the addition of sorbic acid or potassium sorbate);
(b)
to improve or maintain their appearance (for example, by the addition of vegetable oil or small quantities of glucose syrup),
provided that they retain the character of dried fruit or dried nuts.
4.
Heading 08.12 applies to fruit and nuts which have been treated solely to ensure their provisional preservation during transport or storage prior to use (for example, by sulphur dioxide gas, in brine, in sulphurwater or in other preservative solutions), provided they remain unsuitable for immediate consumption in that state.

(b)
medicaments of heading 30.03 or 30.04;or
(c)
mixed unsaturated hydrocarbons of heading 33.01, 33.02 or 38.05.
2.
References in heading 27.10 to "petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals" include not only petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals but also similar oils, as well as thoseconsisting mainly of mixed unsaturated hydrocarbons, obtained by any process, provided the mass of the non-aromatic constituents exceeds that of the aromatic constituents.However, the references do not include liquid synthetic polyolefins of which less than 60 per cent by volume distils at 300°C, after conversion to 1,013 millibars when a reduced-pressure distillation method isused (Chapter 39).
3.
For the purposes of heading 27.10, "waste oils" means waste containing mainly petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals (as described in Note 2 to this Chapter), whether or not mixed withwater. These include:(a)
such oils no longer fit for use as primary products (for example, used lubricating oils, used hydraulic oils and used transformer oils);
(b)
sludge oils from the storage tanks of petroleum oils, mainly containing such oils and a high concentration of additives (for example, chemicals) used in the manufacture of primary products; and
(c)
such oils in the form of emulsions in water or mixtures with water, such as those resulting from oil spills or storage tank washings, or from the use of cutting oils for machining operations.
SUBHEADING NOTES:1.
For the purposes of subheading 2701.11, "anthracite" means coal having a volatile matter limit (on a dry, mineral-matter-free basis) not exceeding 14 per cent.
2.
For the purposes of subheading 2701.12, "bituminous coal" means coal having a volatile matter limit (on a dry, mineral-matter-free basis) exceeding 14 per cent and a calorific value limit (on a moist, mineral-matter-free basis) equal to or greater than 5,833 kcal/kg.
3.
For the purposes of subheadings 2707.10, 2707.20, 2707.30 and 2707.40, the terms "benzol (benzene)", "toluol (toluene)", "xylol (xylenes)" and "naphthalene" apply to products which contain more than 50per cent by mass of benzene, toluene, xylenes or naphthalene, respectively.
4.
For the purposes of subheading 2710.12, "light oils and preparations" are those of which 90 per cent or more by volume (including losses) distil at 210°C according to the ISO 3405 method (equivalent to theASTM D 86 method).
5.
For the purposes of the subheadings of heading 27.10, the term "biodiesel" means mono-alkyl esters of fatty acids of a kind used as a fuel, derived from animal, vegetable or microbial fats and oils whether ornot used.
ADDITIONAL NOTES:1.
Specifications:In this Chapter the following expressions shall be deemed to refer to hydrocarbon fuels and oils which are liquid at normal temperature and presure (20°C; one atmosphere) and which comply with all of thespecifications hereunder assigned thereto or with any other specifications accepted or determined by the Commissioner (unless otherwise stated, the specification properties will be determined by the methodsspecified below) provided the intended uses of such fuels and oils are considered by the Commissioner in every case to be specified hereunder in respect of such fuels and oils.Methods to determine Specification Properties:

CHAPTER 29
ORGANIC CHEMICALS
NOTES:1.
Except where the context otherwise requires, the headings of this Chapter apply only to the following:(a)
separate chemically defined organic compounds, whether or not containing impurities;
(b)
mixtures of two or more isomers of the same organic compound (whether or not containing impurities), except mixtures of acyclic hydrocarbon isomers (excluding stereoisomers), whether or notsaturated (Chapter 27);
(c)
the products of headings 29.36 to 29.39 or the sugar ethers, sugar acetals and sugar esters, and their salts, of heading 29.40, or the products of heading 29.41, whether or not chemically defined;
(d)
the products mentioned in (a), (b) or (c) above dissolved in water;
(e)
the products mentioned in (a), (b) or (c) above dissolved in other solvents provided the solution constitutes a normal and necessary method of putting up these products adopted solely for reasons ofsafety or for transport and that the solvent does not render the product particularly suitable for specific use rather than for general use;
(f)
the products mentioned in (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above with an added stabiliser (including an anti-caking agent) necessary for their preservation or transport;
(g)
The products mentioned in (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) above with an added anti-dusting agent or a colouring or odoriferous substance or an emetic added to facilitate their identification or for safetyreasons, provided that the additions do not render the product particularly suitable for specific use rather than for general use;
(h)
the following products, diluted to standard strengths, for the production of azo dyes: diazonium salts, couplers used for these salts and diazotisable amines and their salts.
2.
This Chapter does not cover the following:(a)
goods of heading 15.04 or crude glycerol of heading 15.20;
(b)
ethyl alcohol (heading 22.07 or 22.08);
(c)
methane or propane (heading 27.11);
(d)
the compounds of carbon mentioned in Note 2 to Chapter 28;
(e)
immunological products of heading 30.02;
(f)
urea (heading 31.02 or 31.05);
(g)
colouring matter of vegetable or animal origin (heading 32.03), synthetic organic colouring matter, synthetic organic products of a kind used as fluorescent brightening agents or as luminophores(heading 32.04) or dyes or other colouring matter put up in forms or packings for retail sale (heading 32.12);
(h)
enzymes (heading 35.07);
(ij)
metaldehyde, hexamethylenetetramine or similar substances, put up in forms (for example, tablets, sticks or similar forms) for use as fuels, or liquid or liquefied-gas fuels in containers of a kind usedfor filling or refilling cigarette or similar lighters and of a capacity not exceeding 300 cm³ (heading 36.06);
(k)
products put up as charges for fire-extinguishers or put up in fire-extinguishing grenades, of heading 38.13; ink removers put up in packings for retail sale, of heading 38.24; or
(l)
optical elements, for example, of ethylenediamine tartrate (heading 90.01).
3.
Goods which could be included in two or more of the headings of this Chapter are to be classified in that one of those headings which occurs last in numerical order.
4.
In headings 29.04 to 29.06, 29.08 to 29.11 and 29.13 to 29.20, any reference to halogenated, sulphonated, nitrated or nitrosated derivatives includes a reference to compound derivatives, such assulphohalogenated, nitrohalogenated, nitrosulphonated or nitrosulphohalogenated derivatives.Nitro or nitroso groups are not to be taken as "nitrogen-functions" for the purposes of heading 29.29.For the purposes of headings 29.11, 29.12, 29.14, 29.18 and 29.22, oxygen function, the characteristic organic oxygen-containing group of those respective headings, is restricted to the oxygen-functionsreferred to in headings 29.05 to 29.20.

(A)
The esters of acid-function organic compounds of sub-chapters I to VII with organic compounds of these sub-chapters are to be classified with that compound which is classified in the heading whichoccurs last in numerical order in these sub-chapters.
(B)
Esters of ethyl alcohol with acid-function organic compounds of sub-chapters I to VII are to be classified in the same heading as the corresponding acid-function compounds.
(C)
Subject to Note 1 to Section VI and Note 2 to Chapter 28:(i)
inorganic salts of organic compounds such as acid-, phenol- or enol-function compounds or organic bases, of sub-chapters I to X or heading 29.42, are to be classified in the headingappropriate to the organic compound;
(ii)
salts formed between organic compounds of sub-chapters I to X or heading 29.42 are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the base or to the acid (including phenol- or enol-functioncompounds) from which they are formed, whichever occurs last in numerical order in the Chapter; and
(iii
co-ordination compounds, other than products classifiable in sub-Chapter XI or heading 29.41, are to be classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order in Chapter 29, amongthose appropriate to the fragments formed by "cleaving" of all metal bonds, other than metal-carbon bonds.
(D)
Metal alcoholates are to be classified in the same heading as the corresponding alcohols except in the case of ethanol (heading 29.05).
(E)
Halides of carboxylic acids are to be classified in the same heading as the corresponding acids.
6.
The compounds of headings 29.30 and 29.31 are organic compounds the molecules of which contain, in addition to atoms of hydrogen, oxygen or nitrogen, atoms of other non-metals or of metals (such assulphur, arsenic or lead) directly linked to carbon atoms.Heading 29.30 (organo-sulphur compounds) and heading 29.31 (other organo-inorganic compounds) do not include sulphonated or halogenated derivatives (including compound derivatives) which, apart fromhydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, only have directly linked to carbon the atoms of sulphur or of a halogen which give them their nature of sulphonated or halogenated derivatives (or compound derivatives).
7.
Headings 29.32, 29.33 and 29.34 do not include epoxides with a three-membered ring, ketone peroxides, cyclic polymers of aldehydes or of thioaldehydes, anhydrides of polybasic carboxylic acids, cyclicesters of polyhydric alcohols or phenols with polybasic acids, or imides of polybasic acids.These provisions apply only when the ring-position hetero-atoms are those resulting solely from the cyclising function or functions here listed.
8.
For the purposes of heading 29.37:(a)
the term "hormones" includes hormone-releasing or hormone-stimulating factors, hormone inhibitors and hormone antagonists (anti-hormones);
(b)
the expression "used primarily as hormones" applies not only to hormone derivatives and structural analogues used primarily for their hormonal effect, but also to those derivatives and structuralanalogues used primarily as intermediates in the synthesis of products of this heading.
SUBHEADING NOTES:1.
Within any one heading of this Chapter, derivatives of a chemical compound (or group of chemical compounds) are to be classified in the same subheading as that compound (or group of compounds)provided that they are not more specifically covered by any other subheading and that there is no residual subheading named "Other" in the series of subheadings concerned.
2.
Note 3 to Chapter 29 does not apply to the subheadings of this Chapter.

resols (heading 39.09) and other prepolymers.
4.
The expression "copolymers" cover all polymers in which no single monomer unit contributes 95 per cet or more by mass to the total polymer content.For the purposes of this Chapter, except where the context otherwise requires, copolymers (including co-polycondensates, co-polyaddition products, block copolymers and graft copolymers) and polymerblends are to be classified in the heading covering polymers of that comonomer unit which predominates by mass over every other single comonomer unit. For the purposes of this Note, constituentcomonomers units of polymers falling in the same heading shall be taken together.If no single comonomer unit predominates, copolymers or polymer blends, as the case may be, are to be classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally meritconsideration.
5.
Chemically modified polymers, that is those in which only appendages to the main polymer chain have been changed by chemical reaction, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the unmodifiedpolymer.This provision does not apply to graft copolymers.
6.
In headings 39.01 to 39.14, the expression "primary forms" applies only to the following forms:(a)
Liquids and pastes, including dispersions (emulsions and suspensions) and solutions.
(b)
Blocks of irregular shape, lumps, powders (including moulding powders), granules, flakes and similar bulk forms.
7.
Heading 39.15 does not apply to waste, parings and scrap of a single thermoplastic material, transformed into primary forms (headings 39.01 to 39.14).
8.
For the purposes of heading 39.17, the expression "tubes, pipes and hoses" means hollow products, whether semi-manufactures or finished products, of a kind generally used for conveying, conducting ordistributing gases or liquids (for example, ribbed garden hose, perforated tubes). This expression also includes sausage casings and other lay-flat tubing. However, except for the last-mentioned, those havingan internal cross-section other than round, oval, rectangular (in which the length does not exceed 1,5 times the width) or in the shape of a regular polygon are not to be regarded as tubes, pipes and hoses butas profile shapes.
9.
For the purposes of heading 39.18, the expression "wall or ceiling coverings of plastics" applies to products in rolls, of a width not less than 45 cm, suitable for wall or ceiling decoration, consisting of plasticsfixed permanently on a backing of any material other than paper, the layer of plastics (on the face side) being grained, embossed, coloured, design-printed or otherwise decorated.
10.
In headings 39.20 and 39.21, the expression "plates, sheets, film, foil and strip" applies only to plates, sheets, film, foil and strip (excluding those of Chapter 54) and to blocks of regular geometric shape,whether or not printed or otherwise surface-worked, uncut or cut into rectangles (including squares) but not further worked (even if when so cut they become articles ready for use).
11.
Heading 39.25 applies only to the following articles, not being products covered by any of the earlier headings of Subchapter II:(a)
reservoirs, tanks (including septic tanks), vats and similar containers, of a capacity exceeding 300 litres;
(b)
structural elements used, for example, in floors, walls or partitions, ceilings or roofs;
(c)
gutters and fittings therefor;
(d)
doors, windows and their frames and thresholds for doors;
(e)
balconies, balustrades, fencing, gates and similar barriers;
(f)
shutters, blinds (including venetian blinds) and similar articles and parts and fittings thereof;
(g)
large-scale shelving for assembly and permanent installation, for example, in shops, workshops, warehouses;
(h)
ornamental architectural features, for example, flutings, cupolas, dovecotes; and
(ij
fittings and mountings intended for permanent installation in or on doors, windows, staircases, walls or other parts of buildings, for example, knobs, handles, hooks, brackets, towel rails, switch-platesand other protective plates.

SCHEDULE 1 / PART 1 / SECTION VII
Customs & Excise Tariff

1.
Within any one heading of this Chapter, polymers (including copolymers) and chemically modified polymers are to be classified according to the following provisions:(a)
Where there is a subheading named "Other" in the same series:(1)
The designation in a subheading of a polymer by the prefix "poly" (for example, polyethylene and polyamide-6,6) means that the constituent monomer unit or monomer units of the namedpolymer taken together must contribute 95 per cent or more by mass of the total polymer content.
(2)
The copolymers named in subheadings 3901.30, 3901.40, 3903.20, 3903.30 and 3904.30 are to be classified in those subheadings, provided that the comonomer units of the namedcopolymers contribute 95 per cent or more by mass of the total polymer content.
(3)
Chemically modified polymers are to be classified in the subheading named "Other", provided that the chemically modified polymers are not more specifically covered by anothersubheading.
(4)
Polymers not meeting (1), (2) and (3) above, are to be classified in the subheading, among the remaining subheadings in the series, covering polymers of that monomer unit whichpredominates by mass over every single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together. Only constituentcomonomer units of the polymers in the series of subheadings under consideration are to be compared.
(b)
Where there is no subheading named "Other" in the same series:(1)
Polymers are to be classified in the subheading covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by mass over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituentmonomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series under consideration are to becompared.
(2)
Chemically modified polymers are to be classified in the subheading appropriate to the unmodified polymer.
Polymer blends are to be classified in the same subheading as polymers of the same monomer units in the same proportions.
2.
For the purposes of subheading 3920.43, the term "plasticisers" includes secondary plasticisers.
ADDITIONAL NOTES:1.
For the purposes of headings 39.01 to 39.14 the word "powder" means products of which 90 per cent or more, by mass, passes through a sieve having a mesh aperture of 420 micrometres.
2.
For the purposes of this Chapter the expression "heat shrinkable" applies to products which at a temperature of 120°C have a shrinkage coefficient of 15 per cent or more.
3.
For the purposes of subheadings 3923.21.07, 3923.21.17, 3923.29.40 and 3923.29.50 the expression:(a)
"carrier bags" shall mean bags constructed with handles, and with or without gussets;
(b)
"flat bags" shall mean bags constructed without handles, and with or without gussets; and
(c)
"immediate packings" shall mean bags that are in direct or immediate contact with the products and are used for packing goods in sets or units or other marketable quantities but does not extend tobags in which such sets or units or other marketable quantities are packed for ease of transport or consolidation purposes.

3.
In headings 40.01 to 40.03 and 40.05 the expression "primary forms" applies only to the following forms:(a)
liquids and pastes (including latex, whether or not prevulcanised, and other dispersions and solutions);
(b)
blocks of irregular shape, lumps, bales, powders, granules, crumbs and similar bulk forms.
4.
In Note 1 to this Chapter and in heading 40.02, the expression "synthetic rubber" applies to:(a)
unsaturated synthetic substances which can be irreversibly transformed by vulcanisation with sulphur into non-thermoplastic substances which, at a temperature between 18°C and 29°C, will notbreak on being extended to three times their original length and will return, after being extended to twice their original length, within a period of five minutes, to a length not greater than one and a halftimes their original length. For the purposes of this test, substances necessary for the cross-linking, such as vulcanising activators or accelerators, may be added; the presence of substances asprovided for by Note 5(B)(ii) and (iii) is also permitted. However, the presence of any substances not necessary for the cross-linking, such as extenders, plasticisers and fillers, is not permitted;
(b)
thioplasts (TM); and
(c)
natural rubber modified by grafting or mixing with plastics, depolymerised natural rubber, mixtures of unsaturated synthetic substances with saturated synthetic high polymers provided all the above-mentioned products comply with the requirements concerning vulcanisation, elongation and recovery in (a) above.
5.
(A)
Headings 40.01 and 40.02 do not apply to any rubber or mixture of rubbers which has been compounded, before or after coagulation, with:(i)
vulcanising agents, accelerators, retarders or activators (other than those added for the preparation of pre-vulcanised rubber latex);
(ii)
pigments or other colouring matter, other than those added solely for the purpose of identification;
(iii
plasticisers or extenders (except mineral oil in the case of oil-extended rubber), fillers, reinforcing agents, organic solvents or any other substances, except those permitted under (B);
(B)
The presence of the following substances in any rubber or mixture of rubbers shall not affect its classification in heading 40.01 or 40.02, as the case may be, provided that such rubber or mixture ofrubbers retains its essential character as a raw material:(i)
emulsifiers or anti-tack agents;
(ii)
small amount of breadown products of emulsifiers;
(iii
very small amounts of the following: heat-sensitive agents (generally for obtaining thermosensitive rubber latexes), cationic surface-active agents (generally for obtaining electro-positiverubber latexes), antioxidants, coagulants, crumbling agents, freeze-resisting agents, peptisers, preservatives, stabilisers, viscosity-control agents, or similar special-purpose additives.
6.
For the purposes of heading 40.04 the expression "waste, parings and scrap" means rubber waste, parings and scrap from the manufacture or working of rubber and rubber goods definitely not usable as suchbecause of cutting-up, wear or other reasons.
7.
Thread wholly of vulcanised rubber, of which any cross-sectional dimension exceeds 5 mm, is to be classified as strip, rods or profile shapes, of heading 40.08.

CHAPTER 54
MAN-MADE FILAMENTS; STRIP AND THE LIKE OF MAN-MADE TEXTILE MATERIALS
NOTES:1.
Throughout this Schedule, the term "man-made fibres" means staple fibres and filaments of organic polymers produced by manufacturing processes, either:(a)
by polymerisation of organic monomers to produce polymers such as polyamides, polyesters, polyolefins or polyurethanes, or by chemical modification of polymers produced by this process (forexample, poly(vinyl alcohol) prepared by the hydrolysis of poly(vinyl acetate); or
(b)
by dissolution of chemical treatment of natural organic polymers (for example, cellulose) to produce polymers such as cuprammonium rayon (cupro) or viscose rayon, or by chemical modification ofnatural organic polymers (for example, cellulose, casein and other proteins, or algiric acid), to produce polymers such as cellulose acetate or alginates.
The terms "synthetic" and "artificial", used in relation to fibres, mean: synthetic: fibres as defined at (a); artificial :fibres as defined at (b) Strip and the like of heading 54.04 or 54.05 are not considered to beman-made fibres.The terms "man-made", "synthetic" and "artificial" shall have the same meanings when used in relation to "textile materials".
2.
Headings 54.02 and 54.03 do not apply to synthetic or artificial filament tow of Chapter 55.

(d)
front windscreens (windshields), rear windows and other windows, framed, for vehicles of Chapters 86 to 88;
(e)
front windscreens (windshields), rear windows and other windows, whether or not framed, incorporating heating devices or other electrical or electronic devices, for vehicles of Chapter 86 to 88
(f)
optical fibres, optically worked optical elements, hypodermic syringes, artificial eyes, thermometers, barometers, hydrometers or other articles of Chapter 90;
(g)
lamps and lighting fittings, illuminated signs, illuminated name-plates and the like, having a permanently fixed light source, or parts thereof of heading 94.05;
(h)
toys, games, sports requisites, Christmas tree ornaments or other articles of Chapter 95 (excluding glass eyes without mechanisms for dolls or for other articles of Chapter 95); or
(ij)
buttons, fitted vacuum flasks, scent or similar sprays or other articles of Chapter 96.
2.
For the purposes of headings 70.03, 70.04 and 70.05:(a)
glass is not regarded as "worked" by reason of any process it has undergone before annealing;
(b)
cutting to shape does not affect the classification of glass in sheets;
(c)
the expression "absorbent, reflecting or non-reflecting layer" means a microscopically thin coating of metal or of a chemical compound (for example, metal oxide) which absorbs, for example, infra-redlight or improves the reflecting qualities of the glass while still allowing it to retain a degree of transparency or translucency; or which prevents light from being reflected on the surface of the glass.
3.
The products referred to in heading 70.06 remain classified in that heading whether or not they have the character of articles.
4.
For the purposes of heading 70.19, the expression "glass wool" means:(a)
mineral wools with a silica (SiO[2]) content not less than 60 per cent by mass;
(b)
mineral wools with a silica (SiO[2]) content less than 60 per cent but with an alkaline oxide (K[2]O or Na[2]O) content exceeding 5 per cent by mass or a boric oxide (B[2]O[3]) content exceeding 2percent by mass.
Mineral wools which do not comply with the above specifications fall in heading 68.06.
5.
Throughout this Schedule, the expression "glass" includes fused quartz and other fused silica.
SUBHEADING NOTE:1.
For the purposes of subheadings 7013.22, 7013.33, 7013.41 and 7013.91, the expression "lead crystal" means only glass having a minimum lead monoxide (PbO) content by mass of 24 per cent.
ADDITIONAL NOTE:1.
For the purposes of this Chapter, the expression "optical glass" means special glasses used in the manufacture of optical instruments for photography, astronomy, observation (for example, microscopy,navigation), armaments (for example, sighting telescopes), laboratories or for the manufacture of corrective spectacle lenses. These glasses are highly transparent. They may have special light absorptiveproperties and therefore be coloured or black. They are clear, homogeneous, without air bubbles, and have refractive indices and dispersive powers unusual in other glasses.
2.
For the purposes of this Chapter, the expression "solar glass" means glass sheets with an iron content of less than 300 parts per million (ppm) and solar transmittance of more than 88% (measured accordingto ISO 9050:AM 1,5)
3.
Shower enclosures of tariff subheading 7020.00.10 are classified in this subheading whether or not framed, trimmed, fitted with hinges, door handles and the like.

Other elements*, each
0,3
* Other elements are for example:Al, Be, Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, Si.
(b)
COPPER ALLOYS:Metallic substances (excluding unrefined copper) in which copper predominates by mass over each of the other elements, provided:(i)
the content by mass of at least one of the other elements is greater than the limit specified in the foregoing table; or
(ii)
the total content by mass of such other elements exceeds 2,5 per cent.
(c)
MASTER ALLOYS:Alloys containing with other elements more than 10 per cent by mass of copper, not usefully malleable and commonly used as an additive in the manufacture of other alloys or as de-oxidants, de-sulphurising agents or for similar uses in the metallurgy of non-ferrous metals. However, copper phosphide (phosphor copper) containing more than 15 per cent by mass of phosphorus falls inheading 28.53.
SUBHEADING NOTES:1.
In this Chapter the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:(a)
COPPER-ZINC BASE ALLOYS (BRASSES):Alloys of copper and zinc, with or without other elements. When other elements are present:-
zinc predominates by mass over each of such other elements;
-
any nickel content by mass is less than 5 per cent (see copper-nickel-zinc alloys (nickel silvers)); and
Date: 2025-05-09

-
any tin content by mass is less than 3 per cent (see copper-tin alloys (bronzes).
(b)
COPPER-TIN BASE ALLOYS (BRONZES):Alloys of copper and tin, with or without other elements. When other elements are present, tin predominates by mass over each of such other elements, except that when the tin content is 3 per centor more the zinc content by mass may exceed that of tin but must be less than 10 per cent.
(c)
COPPER-NICKEL-ZINC BASE ALLOYS (NICKEL SILVERS):Alloys of copper, nickel and zinc, with or without other elements.The nickel content is 5 per cent or more by mass (see copper-zinc alloys (brasses)).
(d)
COPPER-NICKEL BASE ALLOYS:Alloys of copper and nickel, with or without other elements but in any case containing by mass not more than 1 per cent of zinc.When other elements are present, nickel predominates by mass overeach of such other elements.
