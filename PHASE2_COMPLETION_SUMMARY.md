# Phase 2: Core MVP Interface - Completion Summary

## Completed Components

### 1. Chat Interface (`/src/components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx`)
- ✅ Integrated WCO-compliant GRI Engine for sequential rule enforcement
- ✅ Decision Logger for immutable audit trails
- ✅ Legal Framework Manager for compliance validation
- ✅ Dynamic form integration for structured data collection
- ✅ Real-time GRI progress tracking
- ✅ Legal compliance warnings and documentation

### 2. Dynamic Form (`/src/components/forms/DynamicForm.tsx`)
- ✅ Pre-configured forms for different classification stages:
  - Product Details Form (physical characteristics, materials, function)
  - Section Selection Form (with exclusion note handling)
  - Essential Character Analysis Form
- ✅ Built-in validation with legal compliance requirements
- ✅ Metadata tracking for audit trails
- ✅ Context-aware form rendering based on GRI rule

### 3. GRI Step Component (`/src/components/classification/GRIStep.tsx`)
- ✅ Visual progress indicator for GRI rule application
- ✅ Shows current rule with legal text
- ✅ Tracks completed, current, and remaining steps
- ✅ Highlights mandatory steps
- ✅ Legal compliance warnings

### 4. GRI Engine Integration
- ✅ Connected WCOCompliantGRIEngine to ChatInterface
- ✅ Sequential rule enforcement implemented
- ✅ Decision recording with legal basis
- ✅ Progress tracking and validation
- ✅ Confidence scoring for each decision

## Key Features Implemented

### Legal Compliance
- Every decision is recorded with timestamp, reasoning, and legal basis
- GRI rules cannot be skipped (enforced sequentially)
- Low confidence decisions are flagged
- Complete audit trail with cryptographic hashing

### User Experience
- Conversational interface guides users through classification
- Dynamic forms appear when structured input is needed
- Visual progress tracking shows where in the process they are
- Quick actions for common responses
- Clear legal warnings about compliance requirements

### Technical Implementation
- Type-safe TypeScript implementation
- React 18 with Next.js 14
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons

## Known Issues
- React type compatibility warnings with lucide-react icons (non-blocking)
- These are TypeScript warnings that don't prevent the app from running

## Next Steps (Phase 3)
1. Build Legal Report Generator
2. Add compliance features (external timestamps, BTI integration)
3. Implement LLM integration for classification assistance

## Testing Required
- User flow through complete classification process
- Form validation and error handling
- GRI rule sequential enforcement
- Audit trail integrity verification
- Legal compliance report generation

The core MVP interface is now functional and ready for integration with the legal report generator in Phase 3.
