For the purposes of headings 70.03, 70.04 and 70.05:(a) glass is not regarded as \"worked\" by reason of any process it has undergone before annealing; (b) cutting to shape does not affect the classification of glass in sheets; (c) the expression \"absorbent, reflecting or non-reflecting layer\" means a microscopically thin coating of metal or of a chemical compound (for example, metal oxide) which absorbs, for example, infra-redlight or improves the reflecting qualities of the glass while still allowing it to retain a degree of transparency or translucency; or which prevents light from being reflected on the surface of the glass. 3. The products referred to in heading 70.06 remain classified in that heading whether or not they have the character of articles. 4. For the purposes of heading 70.19, the expression \"glass wool\" means:(a) mineral wools with a silica (SiO[2]) content not less than 60 per cent by mass; (b) mineral wools with a silica (SiO[2]) content less than 60 per cent but with an alkaline oxide (K[2]O or Na[2]O) content exceeding 5 per cent by mass or a boric oxide (B[2]O[3]) content exceeding 2percent by mass. Mineral wools which do not comply with the above specifications fall in heading 68.06. 5. Throughout this Schedule, the expression \"glass\" includes fused quartz and other fused silica. SUBHEADING NOTE:1. For the purposes of subheadings 7013.22, 7013.33, 7013.41 and 7013.91, the expression \"lead crystal\" means only glass having a minimum lead monoxide (PbO) content by mass of 24 per cent. ADDITIONAL NOTE:1. For the purposes of this Chapter, the expression \"optical glass\" means special glasses used in the manufacture of optical instruments for photography, astronomy, observation (for example, microscopy,navigation), armaments (for example, sighting telescopes), laboratories or for the manufacture of corrective spectacle lenses. These glasses are highly transparent. They may have special light absorptiveproperties and therefore be coloured or black. They are clear, homogeneous, without air bubbles, and have refractive indices and dispersive powers unusual in other glasses. 2. For the purposes of this Chapter, the expression \"solar glass\" means glass sheets with an iron content of less than 300 parts per million (ppm) and solar transmittance of more than 88% (measured accordingto ISO 9050:AM 1,5) 3. Shower enclosures of tariff subheading 7020.00.10 are classified in this subheading whether or not framed, trimmed, fitted with hinges, door handles and the like.",
